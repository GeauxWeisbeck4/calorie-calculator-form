# Calorie Calculator Form

I created the Calorie Calculator Form during the FreeCodeCamp.org JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures course that walks you through how to do so.

Things that were reviewed in this project were using event listeners, query selectors, creating if and for loops, and also just using form validation with JavaScript.

It was a fun and enlightening project. I hope you enjoy using it to calculate your caloric intake and it helps you budget those calories correctly!
